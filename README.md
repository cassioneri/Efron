On Continuous Efron's Dice
=====

A die D<sub>1</sub> is said to be stronger than another die D<sub>2</sub> if the propability of D<sub>1</sub> beating D<sub>2</sub> is bigger than 1/2. It is natural to expect that being stronger is a transitive relationship, that is, if D<sub>1</sub> is stronger than D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> is stronger than D<sub>3</sub>, then D<sub>1</sub> is stronger than D<sub>3</sub>. Efron’s dice are a set of four dice invented by Bradley Efron which is a counter-example for the transitivity [1][Wikipedia].
In this document, instead of a set of four dice, we consider a set of independent continuous random
variables X<sub>1</sub> , ..., X<sub>M</sub> such that P(X<sub>1</sub> > X<sub>2</sub>) = ... = P (X<sub>M −1</sub> > X<sub>M</sub>) = P (X<sub>M</sub> > X<sub>1</sub> ) = p. Under
certain technical assumptions, we shall see that p &le; 3/4.
